## 📥 Dataset

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository — SMS Spam Collection (Tiago A. Almeida & José María Gómez Hidalgo, 2012)
- **Mirror:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/pycon-2016-tutorial/master/data/sms.tsv`
- **Kaggle Alternative:** Search “SMS Spam Collection Dataset” on Kaggle
- **Shape:** 5,574 rows × 2 columns (`label`, `message`)
- **Distribution:** ham 86.6% (4,827) / spam 13.4% (747) — imbalanced
- **No download needed** — notebook tries local `spam.csv` then auto-downloads from GitHub raw if missing.

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. EDA
- Null check, duplicate check, length/word-count stats
- Class distribution bar + pie charts
- Message length histograms & boxplots by class → spam is longer on average

### 2. Text Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
lowercase → remove punctuation/numbers → tokenise → remove stopwords → Porter stemming → rejoin
```
- Example:  
  `Free entry in 2 a wkly comp to win FA Cup...` → `free entri wkli comp win fa cup...`

### 3. Feature Extraction — TF-IDF
**TF-IDF = Term Frequency × Inverse Document Frequency**
- TF: local importance (how often a word appears in this message)
- IDF: `log(N / df)` — boosts rare discriminative words (`claim`, `prize`, `urgent`) and down-weights ubiquitous words (`you`, `go`)
- Config: `max_features=5000`, `ngram_range=(1,2)` (unigrams + bigrams like “free prize”), `min_df=2`, `max_df=0.95`

### 4. Train/Test Split
- 80/20, `stratify=y`, `random_state=42` → preserves 86/14 ratio in both splits
- **TF-IDF fitted only on train** to avoid leakage

### 5. Models Trained (3 for robustness)
| Model | Params | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | default | Classic for text, fast, strong baseline |
| Logistic Regression | `solver=liblinear`, `class_weight=balanced` | Handles sparse high-dim, interpretable |
| Linear SVM | `LinearSVC`, `class_weight=balanced` | Max-margin, often top accuracy on text |

### 6. Evaluation (Test set n=1,115)
| Model | Accuracy | Precision (spam) | Recall (spam) | F1 (spam) |
|-------|----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Logistic Regression 🏆** | **0.9767** | 0.902 | **0.9262** | **0.9139** |
| Linear SVM | 0.9758 | 0.9122 | 0.9060 | 0.9091 |
| Multinomial NB | 0.9695 | 0.9832 | 0.7852 | 0.8731 |

> **Best Model: Logistic Regression** — highest F1 (0.9139) and Recall (0.9262), best balance for spam safety.

- Confusion matrices plotted for each model (TN, FP, FN, TP)
- Classification reports & Precision-Recall curves included

### 7. Why Recall Matters (Section 9)
- **False Negative (spam missed → inbox)** = phishing/malware risk → high cost
- **False Positive (ham → spam folder)** = inconvenience → lower cost
- Therefore **Recall = TP/(TP+FN)** (spam catch rate) is primary; Accuracy is misleading (86% by predicting all ham, but Recall=0)
- Our best Recall ~92.6% → only ~7% spam slips through; production adds blacklists & user feedback loops.

### 8. WordClouds & Error Analysis
- Ham cloud: conversational (“go”, “get”, “love”, “time”)
- Spam cloud: transactional (“free”, “claim”, “win”, “prize”, “txt”, “urgent”)
- 5 misclassified examples inspected: FN often lack classic keywords or use obfuscation; FP often ham with promotional language.

## 🔮 Custom Prediction Demo

The notebook ends with a live demo on unseen custom messages:

```python
"Congratulations! You have won a $1000 cash prize..."  → SPAM 🚨
"Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight?"              → HAM ✅
"URGENT: Your account has been compromised..."          → SPAM 🚨
"Happy birthday! Hope you have a wonderful day :)"      → HAM ✅
```

## 📈 Limitations & Next Steps

| Current | Production Upgrade |
|---------|-------------------|
| Bag-of-words TF-IDF | Transformer embeddings (BERT/DistilBERT) |
| Static 5k vocab | Subword tokenisation, multilingual |
| No metadata | Sender reputation, SPF/DKIM, URL blacklists |
| No online learning | User “Report spam” feedback loop |

**Improvements:** character n-grams for obfuscation (`fr33`), URL/phone regex features, XGBoost/LightGBM, Flask API.
